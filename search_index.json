Richardson 1 Abstract Phenology is a first order control on productivity and mediates the biophysical environment by altering albedo, surface roughness length and evapotranspiration. Accurate and transparent modelling of vegetation phenology is therefore key in understanding feedbacks between the biosphere and the climate system. Here, we present the phenor R package and modelling framework. The framework leverages measurements of vegetation phenology from four common phenology observation datasets, the PhenoCam network, the USA National Phenology Network (USA-NPN), the Pan European Phenology Project (PEP725), MODIS phenology (MCD12Q2) combined with (global) retrospective and projected climate data. We show an example analysis using the phenor modelling framework which quickly and easily compares 20 included spring phenology models for three plant functional types. An analysis of model skill using the root mean squared (RMSE) error shows little or no difference regardless of model structure, corroborating previous studies. We argue that addressing this issue will require novel model development combined with easy data assimilation as facilitated by our framework. In conclusion, we hope the phenor phenology modelling framework in the R language and environment for statistical computing will facilitate reproducibility and community driven phenology model development, in order to increase their overall predictive power, and leverage an ever growing number of phenology data products. Note that this is a submitted version of the final manuscript so small changes can apply. However, the main message has remained largely unaltered. "],
["introduction.html", "2 Introduction", " 2 Introduction Seasonal leaf development, or vegetation phenology, is strongly linked to seasonal changes in temperature and considered an indicator of climate change. Currently, rising temperatures due to climate change have moved spring forward in time by 2.3 to 5.2 days per decade since the 1970s (Rosenzweig et al. 2007). Vegetation phenology hereby does not only disproportionately influence ecosystem productivity by advancing and delaying the season (Richardson et al. 2010, 2013), it also changes canopy properties such as albedo and atmospheric boundary layer properties (Sakai et al. 1997; Hollinger et al. 1999). As such, models of seasonal leaf development, rigorously validated against in-situ observations, are key to understanding how climate change will affect ecosystem productivity and biophysical vegetation properties. Luckily, phenology has been recorded by amateurs and professionals, such as national meteorological institutions, supporting contemporary analysis of past or ongoing climate change (Chuine et al. 2004). Recently, individual observations have been formalized into rigorous citizen science efforts through for example USA National Phenology Network (USA-NPN; https://www.usanpn.org/; Betancourt et al. 2005), Project Budburst (http://budburst.org/). In addition, automated camera networks (i.e., the PhenoCam network, https://phenocam.sr.unh.edu/; (Richardson et al. 2018)) or remote sensing (Zhang et al. 2003) provide a canopy wide continuous way of evaluating the development of vegetation across larger areas in a consistent and continuous fashion (White et al. 2009; Melaas et al. 2016). Numerous studies have demonstrated the value of the PhenoCam derived Gcc index, a measure of vegetation greenness as percentage green within a digital image, for characterizing the seasonal trajectory of vegetation color and activity (Keenan et al. 2014; Klosterman et al. 2014; Toomey et al. 2015; Hufkens et al. 2016). Similarly., the MODIS MCD12Q2 phenology product has been a proven source of phenological data (Chen et al. 2016). These observations of vegetation phenology allow us to estimate changes in the timing of vegetation development in response year to year variation in weather as well as climate change and climate variability (Chuine et al. 2004; Vitasse et al. 2009; Melaas et al. 2016). Most process-based models try to simulate the various internal and environmental influences and, to various degrees, take into account whole plant physiological status (paradormancy), internal factors of developing bud (endodormancy) and external factors driving or suppressing seasonal development (ecodormancy)(Lang et al. 1987). One of the first such ecodormancy models was the growing degree day model as proposed by De Reaumur dating back to 1735. Although vegetation phenology is often driven by temperature multiple additional constraints have been proposed including daylength, chilling degrees, precipitation, relative humidity or vapour pressure deficit (Hunter &amp; Lechowicz 1992; Chuine &amp; Cour 1999; García-Mozo et al. 2009; Laube et al. 2013, 2014; Xin et al. 2015). Similarly, fall senescence has been modelled using chilling degree days with additional constraints such as daylength (Archetti et al. 2013; Jeong &amp; Medvigy 2014; Gill et al. 2015). These various models are either used in isolation to address particular physiological questions or included in land surface models to scale phenological processes (Richardson et al. 2011). Model development, in isolation or coupled to larger land surface models, often integrate multiple environmental drivers which increases model complexity (Jeong &amp; Medvigy 2014; Chen et al. 2016). Yet, models which include more complex concepts, based upon growing degree days, do not necessarily perform better than a simple regression based approach. As such, model structures still explain a limited amount of the year-to-year variability, and fail to generalize well (Schaber &amp; Badeck 2003; Linkosalo et al. 2006; Fisher et al. 2007; Clark et al. 2014; Basler 2016). For example, model studies have shown that biologically “incorrect” models can be parameterized to provide good predictions but lacking any biological representation (Hunter &amp; Lechowicz 1992). A study by Migliavacca et al. (2012) has shown that between-model differences by the end of the century are almost as large as differences between-climate scenario values. As a consequence, different model assumptions will behave disproportionately different under future scenarios affecting their potential impacts and uncertainties (Migliavacca et al. 2012). With vegetation phenology as a first order control on ecosystem productivity, accurate and transparent model predictions of vegetation phenology in a changing climate are key. In order to facilitate easy model comparison and future development of new models we developed the phenor model framework for the R language and environment for statistical computing (R Core Team 2016). The phenor R package assimilates four important phenological records across a variety of ecosystem and plant functional types. The assimilated datasets provide extensive coverage in the US and Europe and results can be easily scaled globally using various gridded data products made accessible through the software. Here, we provide a worked example for the phenor R package using the recent standardized PhenoCam dataset (Richardson et al. 2017; http://phenocam.us) to demonstrate the ease with which a suite of phenological models can be evaluated and scaled up from sites to regions and biomes, and extrapolated in both forecast and hindcast modes.

["material-and-methods.html", "3 Material and Methods 3.1 The phenor R package 3.2 A worked example: a quick model comparison", " 3 Material and Methods 3.1 The phenor R package The phenor R package assimilates four important phenological records of either observational, near-surface and satellite remote sensing based records across a variety of ecosystem and plant functional types. The phenor R package combines data from near-surface remote sensing through the PhenoCam network using phenocamr and daymetr R packages into a phenology modelling framework which covers data preparation, model optimization and model visualization and consists of a number of key functions. In addition, data from the USA National Phenology Network (USA-NPN), the Pan European Phenology Project (PEP725) and the MODIS land surface phenology product (MCD12Q2) can be ingested. In the interest of brevity both phenocamr, daymetr R packages and the PhenoCam source data are described in Appendix S1. The format_phenocam() phenor function combines phenophases, downloaded and generated by the phenocamr R package, with the climate data downloaded using the daymetr R package. The function requires the location (path) of the generated phenophase output files, together with parameters specifying the phenophase (direction = rising; with rising for spring or falling for autumn) and the threshold value used (threshold = 25), the Gcc percentile to use (gcc_value = 90, Sonnentag et al. 2012) and the offset as a day-of-year value. The offset is the day-of-year in the previous year on which to start reporting climate data, running until this day in the subsequent year. The function returns model calibration/validation and driver data a nested list of data frames (df), used in subsequent model optimization (see description of optimize_parameters() and model_calibration() below). df = format_phenocam( path = “/path/to/phenocamr/phenophases/”, direction = “rising”, gcc_value = “gcc_90”, threshold = 25, offset = 264) Similarly, the format_pep725() function uses PEP725 observational data together with European E-OBS climate data (Haylock et al. 2008) to compile a consistent calibration/validation dataset for European observational records (e.g., Basler 2016). Data can be downloaded using the download_pep725() function. We provide similar functionality for the USA-NPN data. Data can be downloaded through the USA-NPN application programming interface using download_npn() and correctly formatted with format_npn(). Furthermore, the format_modis() function correctly formats a directory of MODIS MCD12Q2 land surface phenology data (i.e., phenophases, Zhang et al. 2003) as downloaded with the MODISTools R package (Tuck et al. 2014). Spatially scaling of model results is facilitated through a number of functions. The format_daymet() function uses gridded pre-processed Daymet tiles to generate spatially explicit driver data (download_daymet_tiles() and daymet_tmean() functions of daymetr, Appendix S1). The format_eobs() function provides the same functionality for the E-OBS climate data. Yet another source of hindcast data is compiled using the format_berkeley_earth() function, which allows the user to subset 1x1 degree global historical climate data for any year since 1850 through the Berkeley Earth project (Rohde et al. 2012). Similarly, the format_cmip5() function formats 1/4th degree NASA Earth Exchange (NEX) global gridded Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) data of historical reanalysis and representative concentration pathway (RCP 4.5 and RCP8.5) projections. Unlike format_phenocam() or format_modis() no calibration/validation data is included in the gridded spatial data. The resulting dataset of all formatting functions is a nested list with the following layout: phenor_data_structure └─── doy (vector) └─── site (vector, NULL for spatial data) └─── location (matrix, latitude and longitude by row) └─── ltm (vector, value: degrees C) └─── Ti (matrix, columns: years, rows: doy, value: degrees C) └─── Tmaxi (matrix, columns: years, rows: doy, value: degrees C) └─── Tmini (matrix, columns: years, rows: doy, value: degrees C) └─── Li (matrix, columns: years, rows: doy, value: hours/day) └─── VPDi (matrix, columns: years, rows: doy, value: Pa) └─── Pi (matrix, columns: years, rows: doy, value: mm/day) └─── transition_dates (vector, NULL for spatial data) └─── georeferencing (NULL for PhenoCam, MODIS, USA-NPN or PEP725 data) └─── size (size of the spatial data) └─── extent (extent of the spatial data) └─── projection (projection of the spatial data) Within the phenor data structure the top level is a particular site. For each site critical parameters such as the day-of-year range (doy, as specified by the offset), the geographic location (or georeferencing), and matrices holding, minimum temperature (Tmini), maximum temperature (Tmaxi) and mean daily temperature (Ti), precipitation (Pi), vapour pressure deficit (VPDi), daylength in hours (Li), and calibration/validation transition date (transition_dates) data are provided. Matrices are organized with columns representing a given year, and rows representing a given day-of-year. Other data are represented as vectors matching the number of columns present in the climate data matrices. Where necessary, data is truncated to match the available climate data. When certain data sources are missing the content of a field is set to NULL. The optimize_parameters() function in the package allows for the easy optimization of model parameters. This function uses two common optimizers, GenSA (Xiang et al. 2013) and rgenoud (Mebane &amp; Sekhon 2011). The GenSA algorithm combines both the Boltzmann machine and faster Cauchy machine simulated annealing approaches for fast optimizations (Tsallis &amp; Stariolo 1995), while the genoud routine combines an evolutionary algorithm with a derivative based (quasi-Newton) method to solve difficult optimization problems (Mebane &amp; Sekhon 2011). To optimize a calibration/validation dataset (df) one specifies a particular model (e.g., the Thermal Time model, TT), a defined optimizer (e.g., GenSA), an objective function such the root mean squared error (RMSE) and upper-lower parameter limits as well as parameter starting values when required. Additional control parameters, such as the maximum number or iterations (e.g., max.call), can be provided using a list of options to the control parameter. An example function call to optimize a the TT model is provided below. optimal_par = optimize_parameters( par = NULL, data = df, cost = rmse, model = “TT”, method = “GenSA”, lower = c(1,-5,0), upper = c(365,10,2000), control = list(max.call = 40000)) Final predicted values for the optimized parameters can be retrieved by running the estimate_phenology() function with the optimized parameters. results = estimate_phenology(par = optimal_par$par, data = df, model = “TT”) The output will automatically be formatted as a map of phenology dates or a vector, depending on the input data class. However, running models across all grid cells of spatial data would provide a naively broad representation of land surface phenology. For example, only a small subset of the US is dominated by any particular plant functional type (PFT), such as deciduous broadleaf forests. In order to better differentiate between different dominant PFT we include a function land_cover_density() which calculates the percentage coverage of a particular MODIS MCD12Q1 IGBP land cover class (Friedl et al. 2010) within a given raster cell for a given location (i.e., CMIP5 data, see Figure @ref(fig:spatial_scaling)). A wrapper function, model_calibration(), is provided for both the optimize_parameters() and estimate_phenology() functions which integrates the previously described steps providing both summary statistics (RMSE and AICc) and a plot (Figure 3.1 ) of the model fit. Likewise, the model_comparison() function serves as a wrapper for multi-model parameter optimization runs. For a visual comparison limited to two model runs we provide an arrow plot function, arrow_plot(), displaying directional changes in the modelled values between the model outputs (Figure 3.2 ). Figure 3.1: Model calibration output Figure 3.2: Arrow plot 3.2 A worked example: a quick model comparison As a worked example we partially recreate the spring phenology model comparison by Basler (2016) using PhenoCam data. However, we note that a similar exercise could be executed with any of the other phenology data sources available through phenor. The model structures included in this worked example can be described by the three broad categories: (1) as simple linear regression to spring temperature (2) models explaining ecodormancy release only, (3) models explaining the release of endo- and ecodormancy. A reference NULL model assumes a fixed mean date of leaf unfolding. A total of 22 phenology models are included in the package (table 1). These include 20 spring phenology models including precipitation driven models, one fall senescence chilling degree day model and one grassland pollen release model. In our worked example of the phenor R package we will focus only on the 20 spring phenology models. A full list of the model structures and parameter ranges for the models are provided in Table 2 of Appendix S2 and included in the phenor library. TABLE 1 For this study we combined spring phenology dates based on PhenoCam 3-day summary data from the standardized PhenoCam Dataset (Richardson et al. 2017) with Daymet data (Thornton et al. 2017) for three common PFTs, deciduous broadleaf forests, evergreen needleleaf forest and grasslands. A total of 102 sites and 508 site years were included in our calibration/validation dataset, of which 63 were deciduous broadleaf forest sites (358 site years), 18 were evergreen needleleaf forest sites (63 site years) and 21 were grasslands (88 site years). Deciduous broadleaf sites which are moisture limited, and all sites outside Daymet coverage, were excluded from our analysis. The final selected sites span a large geographic area ranging from New Mexico to Southern Alaska, and Maine to California (Figure 3.3). Figure 3.3: Site locations We acknowledge that phenological development as measured using PhenoCam data represent different physiological processes for different PFTs. For example, the phenology of deciduous forests or grasslands is closely linked to the development of new leaf tissues (Keenan et al. 2014; Hufkens et al. 2016) where evergreen forest phenology is determined by dehardening of existing needles at the end of the winter season. Thus, optimized model parameters and their interpretation are specific to each PFT. For all PFTs, model optimization were executed using the default generalized simulated annealing (GenSA) package minimizing the RMSE between the greenness rising PhenoCam phenophase estimations and model predictions (see Appendix S1). The optimizer was run for 40 000 iterations with a starting temperature of 10 000. To determine the influence of locations at the margin of the forest biome on model optimizations a subset of sites centrally located within the deciduous forest biome was created (Melaas et al. 2016, Appendix S2 Table 2). This subset was optimized separately and compared to results for the complete deciduous broadleaf dataset. We assess proper convergence of the optimized parameters by initializing the optimizer using 12 random sets of parameters. We report mean and standard deviations of the RMSE between observations and predictions on the optimized parameter values for all PFTs and the subset generated for deciduous forest sites. We compare model performance with a log transformed ANOVA, combined with a post-hoc Tukey HSD test. Model errors are evaluated for normality using a Shapiro-Wilk test. For illustrative purposes we produce overview maps (Figure @ref(fig:spatial_scaling)) of spatial patterns both in hindcast and forecast mode. In hindcast mode we use 1x1 km Daymet gridded data across New England, while we present the difference in predicted spring phenology (ΔDOY) between years 2100 and 2011 for forecast CMIP5 IPSL-CM5A-MR (Mid-Resolution Institut Pierre Simon Laplace Climate Model 5) model runs, across the contiguous US. The Thermal Time (TT) and Accumulated Growing Season Index models were optimized for deciduous broadleaf and grassland PhenoCam data, respectively. For forecast data only pixels dominated by their particular PFT are displayed, limiting a naively broad interpretation of the results. Our comparison of 20 spring phenology models across three PFT showed that most models were significantly different from the NULL model, with the exception of the SGSI model in the evergreen PFT (post-hoc Tukey HSD test, p &lt; 0.001, Figure 3.4). The model performance of the centrally located deciduous broadleaf sites was marginally greater (RMSE: ~7.6±0.7 days) compared to the complete deciduous broadleaf dataset (RMSE: ~7.9±1.2 days). This difference between the full deciduous broadleaf forest dataset and those more centrally within the biome suggests an influence of geographic location on model error. Figure 3.4: model comparison The influence of different model structures on individual values was visualized using the arrow plot (Figure 3.2) between two model runs. When visually comparing the Thermal Time (TT) and the Photothermal Time (PTT) models small changes are noted (3.2). Both models accumulate growing degree days where the PTT model adds a photoperiod component to the original TT model. In the PTT model leaf unfolding is therefore in part dependent on a daylength requirement in addition to thermal forcing. In our example, the addition of a daylength requirement shifts model results for early and late developing plants toward earlier leaf out dates, while at the same time shifting mid season developing plants toward later leaf out dates. Despite these changes overall model accuracy remains the same. A description of all statistical results is provided in Appendix S1, section 5. (#fig:spatial_scaling)spatial scaling "],
["discussion.html", "4 Discussion", " 4 Discussion Here, we have demonstrated how the phenor R package and its included “model zoo”, together with consistent estimates of vegetation phenology through PhenoCam network (e.g., phenocamr, Appendix S1) or other phenology data sources can be leveraged for a fast and transparent model comparisons. More so, easy access to various gridded data sources allows for quick spatial scaling of optimized models in both hindcast and forecast mode (Figure @ref(fig:spatial_scaling)). For example, the code required to partially reproduce a study by Basler (2016) relied on a mere 15 R commands (see run_model_comparison.r in the phenor manuscript github repository), while the models used are easily readable and well documented. Furthermore, adding model structures is easy compared to other frameworks which rely on either low level languages, are closed source or do not work cross-platform (Hänninen &amp; Kramer 2007; Chuine et al. 2013; Brown et al. 2014)`. More so, to execute our complete case study reasonable processing times were recorded (~ 48 CPU hours on a recent desktop workstation) although relying on a slower scripting language, while computational loads for data generation and processing at a global scale remain marginal. The case study demonstrates the ease with which we executed our model comparisons in phenor, corroborating previous studies and once more highlighting the limitations of current model structures in explaining year-to-year variability (Linkosalo et al. 2006; Fisher et al. 2007; Clark et al. 2014; Basler 2016). This result therefore underscores the need for tools such as phenor to facilitate easy and transparent model development and comparison. Furthermore, new visualization tools such as the arrow plot might help in this process. The arrow plot (Figure 3.2) suggests that the assessment of model skill through summarizing values such as RMSE seem suboptimal, hiding structural differences in model performance hiding important information on model performance. The non-normal distribution of model errors within all models (p &lt; 0.001) suggests as much. "],
["known-limitations.html", "5 Known limitations", " 5 Known limitations We acknowledge that previous efforts have been made to provide phenology model frameworks (Hänninen &amp; Kramer 2007; Chuine et al. 2013; Brown et al. 2014). Yet, their use and interoperability and scaleability is limited due to platform restrictions or their closed source nature. We recognize that the models as currently presented are by no means an exhaustive list of all model structures found in literature. However, the phenor R package is open source and adding model structures is easy compared to other low level languages (e.g., C / Fortran) and is actively encouraged. We are aware that the phenor R package does not include all possible phenological climatological drivers or phenological calibration/validation data either, although we stress that access to four larger freely available phenological data sources is provided by the phenor R package. Similarly, other sources of climate data, such as the ERA-interim re-analysis data (Dee et al. 2011), could be integrated as long as the described data structure is followed. "],
["conclusion.html", "6 Conclusion", " 6 Conclusion Accurately representing vegetation phenology, a first order control on ecosystem productivity, under future conditions is key in understanding feedbacks between the climate and the biosphere. Here, we demonstrated the advantages of the phenor R package and modelling framework, through a worked example, by quickly and easily comparing 20 spring phenology models and their model skill for three plant functional types. Our results corroborate previous analysis, showing little or no difference in predictive power between models, which suggest convenient tools for further analysis or novel model development are needed to capture current and future phenological changes as well as their underlying physiological processes. We hope the phenor phenology modelling framework in R will allow for a better integration of observational and experimental data providing opportunities to better understand the environmental factors driving seasonality, and past and future responses of vegetation to climate change and variability.

The network currently consists of over 400 cameras in the conterminous US, tracking vegetation development. Camera imagery is uploaded and stored on the PhenoCam server. Any new images that have been uploaded to the server during the previous 24 hours are converted into greenness time series from RGB triplets of the recorded JPEG images. Variability in RGB triplets, due to changing scene illumination, can be largely suppressed by converting the DN triplets to their respective chromatic coordinates (e.g. the green chromatic coordinate, Gcc) and subsequent selection of the 90th percentile of the values across a 1 or 3-day period (Richardson et al. 2007, 2009; Sonnentag et al. 2012). Numerous studies have demonstrated the value of the Gcc index (and the corresponding red chromatic coordinate, Rcc) for characterizing the seasonal trajectory of vegetation color and activity (Keenan et al. 2014; Klosterman et al. 2014; Toomey et al. 2015). Furthermore an appropriate “region of interest” (ROI) is defined, corresponding to the area within each digital image for which colour information will be extracted according to the dominant vegetation type in each image. We therefore calculated Gcc as in eq. 1, where X DN denotes the mean (across the ROI) digital number for colour channel X. The generation of these PhenoCam Gcc 1- or 3-day summary product time series is done nightly on the PhenoCam servers. Gcc = green DN / (red DN + green DN + blue DN) (eq.1) 11.2 The phenocamr R package: methodology 11.2.1 Outlier detection and smoothing A first step in the post-processing of the PhenoCam data after downloading the data is the detection of outliers which might confound further analysis. For the outlier detection we rely on an iterative spline-based outlier detection algorithm on each of the GCC time series (mean, 50th, 75th, and 90th quantiles) included in the 1- and 3-day summary product files. First, using a range of smoothing factors, we fit a family of cubic smoothing splines to each of time series. We selected the optimal spline from within this family using Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC, (Akaike 1974)), which balances goodness-of-fit against model complexity in order to avoid over-fitting (Hurvich et al. 1998). Then, in an iterative process, we identified and flagged data points lying more than 2x standard deviations (based on the residual variance,) from the spline. With these outliers excluded, we then repeated the spline fitting process. This was done up to 20 times or until no further outliers were detected from one iteration to the next. The spline fitting process is repeated one final time, so that together with the outlier flags, a smoothed and interpolated time series (with uncertainty estimates) could be used for transition date estimation. The procedure described above can be applied to either 1- or 3-day summary file using both the detect_outliers() and smooth_ts() routines separately. However, it is preferred to specify the proper post-processing routines upon downloading the PhenoCam data using the download_phenocam() function. 11.2.2 Phenophase estimation Changes in the cycle of vegetation activity are identified as change points using the Pruned Exact Linear Time (PELT) method (Killick et al. 2011) for each cycle with a penalty factor (beta = 0.5) and a minimum segment length of 14 days. Extracted phenophases are calculated as changes in the signal between these change points and intended to define the start of the “greenness rising” and end of the “greenness falling” stage for a full cycle of vegetation activity (i.e., from dormancy, through green-up or “greenness rising”, peak activity, senescence or “greenness falling”, and back to dormancy). Thus, unlike sigmoid-based approaches that have been typically used in the literature (Zhang et al. 2003; Hufkens et al. 2012; Klosterman et al. 2014; Filippa et al. 2016), our method is not limited to ecosystems with a single annual cycle of green-up and senescence and invariant to changes in baseline values due to varying camera settings over time (see Figure 11.1). The AIC-selected smoothing spline, described in the previous section, is central to this method. The spline is first used to determine the GCC minima (the baseline before a “greenness rising” stage or after a “greenness falling” stage) and maxima (the peak between “rising” and “falling” stages). From the GCC minima and maxima associated with each stage, we then used the spline to identify the dates when 10%, 25%, and 50% of the amplitude (= maxima – minima) were reached. Different threshold values may be specified by calling the underlying function transition_dates(). Transition date uncertainties were then derived from the confidence interval (1.96 x SE) around the smoothing spline, with a minimum uncertainty extending to the immediately preceding or following observation (i.e., ± 1 and ± 3d for the 1- and 3-day GCC time series, respectively; larger in the case of missing data on either side of the estimated transition date). By default all dates are reported in unix time with a start date at (1970-01-01). 11.3 The phenocamr R package: usage The phenocamr package, most prominently, interfaces with the PhenoCam server to facilitate easy downloading of pre-processed Gcc time series (see section 2) into the R environment. Subsequently, the package screens for outliers in the downloaded time series, smooths the time series and finally estimates different phenophases in a seamless routine. The phenocamr package currently provides all post-processing of PhenoCam standardized datasets (e.g. V1.0; Richardson et al. 2017, In Review). The download_phenocam() function in the package covers most of this functionality. An example of the basic function is provided here: download_phenocam(site = “bartlett”, vegetation = “DB”, roi_id = 0003, frequency = 3, outlier_detection = TRUE, smooth = TRUE, phenophase = TRUE) These instruction download 3-day summary data (frequency = 3) at the Bartlett experimental forest site (site = “bartlett”) for a deciduous broadleaf (DB) ROI (vegetation = “DB”) with ID 0003 (roi_id = 0003). In addition, we specify that outlier detection and smoothing should be applied (outlier_detection, and smooth set to TRUE). Finally, phenophases are estimated for this particular time series (phenophase = TRUE). By default transition dates for the 10, 25 and 50% amplitude threshold are estimated for both rising and falling parts of a Gcc time series, for a detailed description we refer to Appendix S1. A processed Gcc time series at a 3-day time step together with the 25% amplitude of the rising falling stages of each cycle of vegetation activity at the Bartlett experimental forest are shown in 11.1. In the interest of brevity we refer to the package documentation for additional parameter options. 11.4 The daymetr R package Daymet provides gridded estimates of daily weather parameters across North America (Thornton et al. 1997), and makes these data available through an ORNL DAAC web service, to which the daymetr R package provides an interface. A simple download command for a particular location can be executed using the following syntax: download_daymet( site = &quot;bartlett&quot;, lat = 44.0646, lon = -71.2881, start = 1980, end = 2010, internal = TRUE) Here we specify the filename to assign to the data to be downloaded (e.g. “bartlett”) as specified by a given latitude and longitude and a start and end year (start = 1980 and end = 2010, respectively). The ‘internal’ parameter specifies if data should be loaded into the current R workspace (TRUE) or merely downloaded as a comma delimited file (CSV, FALSE) to disk. A similar syntax is used for batch downloading data from a list of locations stored in a CSV file using download_daymet_batch() or downloading gridded (spatial) data through the download_daymet_tiles() and download_daymet_ncss() functions. 11.5 Worked example statistical results Comparing model performance across the 20 spring phenology models and all the three PFT showed that all models were significantly different from the NULL model, except for the SGSI model for the evergreen PFT (post-hoc Tukey HSD test, p &lt; 0.001, Figure 4). We also note that the NULL model for the grassland PFT performed worse compared to either evergreen or deciduous forest PFT (Figure 4d). For grasslands the RMSE of the NULL model equals 32.7 days compared to only 14.5 and 16.1 days for the deciduous and evergreen forest sites respectively. Excluding the NULL model, model RMSE varied greatly among PFTs. For deciduous broadleaf sites an average RMSE of ~9.1 ± 1.2 days was observed (Figure 4a). For the evergreen needleleaf forest and the grassland sites the RMSE values almost doubled (~14.4 ± 0.8 days and ~13.6 ± 2 days respectively, Figure 4c-d). A separate model optimization on centrally located deciduous broadleaf sites resulted in a RMSE ~7.6 ± 0.7 days (Figure 4b). Limiting the deciduous broadleaf sites to locations to those centrally located within the biome point to a marginally higher RMSE of ~7.9 ± 1.2 days. Differences between the full deciduous broadleaf forest dataset and those more centrally within the biome allude to the influence of geographic location on model error. Although our analysis quickly and easily reproduced a limited version of previous work by Basler (2016), only including a subset of the models discussed and omitting extensive cross-validation therein, our study extends this work in other ways. Mainly, we increased the geographic range, covering boreal, temperate and subtropical regions, and included three plant functional types. However, even with this greater range in latitude and the continental scale of the study, as well as three plant functional types, does not change previous findings. Variability between in RMSE between the PFT can largely be explained by differences in phenological processes. Grassland phenology is largely determined by both temperature and plant available water. Yet, two grassland spring phenology models included in phenor which account for water stress through VPD (SGSI, AGSI; Xin et al. 2015) do not perform significantly better than other described models. Heterogeneity, between grassland locations might explain this lack of performance. However, an in depth analysis is outside the scope of this manuscript. Evergreen forest phenology as observed by PhenoCams is not determined by developing leaves but by dehardening of existing needles. Estimates of evergreen phenology therefore might benefit from a model structure focussed on the dehardenning process (Hänninen &amp; Kramer 2007) not yet included in the described models. 11.6 References Akaike, H.
